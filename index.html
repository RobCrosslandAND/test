        In recent news, the Black Lives Matter movement has been gaining
        momentum and coverage due the unfortunate and unlawful killing of George
        Floyd. The black community however have been facing injustices in their
        daily lives for as long as we can remember, and it is a fight for
        Justice that has been taking place long before today. There are
        countless amounts of black people who have made great contributions to
        society as a whole and the fight for equality and justice! See our
